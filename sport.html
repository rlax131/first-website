      <p class="aa">Quidditch (formerly known as Kwidditch and Cuaditch) was a wizarding sport played on
         flying broomsticks. It was the most popular and well-known game among wizards and witches, 
         and, according to Rubeus Hagrid, the wizard equivalent to Muggles' passion for football.
         The game was played by two teams with seven members each. The object of the game was to score
          more points than the opposing team.

    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">While Quidditch was the first (and so far, only) 
      broomstick-based game to attain near-worldwide popularity amongst the wizarding people,
       it was certainly not the first broomstick game. In truth, Quidditch probably owed a debt 
       to a number of its forerunners in making it as successful as it became. All of these archaic
        broom games were popular in localised areas, but none had the vast appeal that Quidditch did.
       The beauty of Quidditch was that it took the best aspects of all its predecessors, added its own 
       unique twists, and ended up as a game that would remain popular with the masses for centuries. </p>
